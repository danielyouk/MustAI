## Project Overview
MustAI integrates various technologies to automate critical engineering processes:
- **Multi-Modal LLM**: Leverages cutting-edge language models to interpret and execute engineering analysis tasks.
- **Python AI**: Utilizes Python for complex calculations and process automation.
- **Mouse & Keyboard Control**: Demonstrates direct control of engineering software through automated mouse and keyboard inputs.

## Current Features
- **Automated Mesh Generation**: Currently in development, aiming to fully automate the setup of engineering simulations.
- **Real-Time Control**: The system can perform tasks in engineering software by simulating user input, as demonstrated in the project's examples.

## Future Development
While the project has achieved significant milestones, areas like automated mesh generation need further development to realize full automation.

## Looking for Collaboration
We are open to collaboration and are looking to transfer this business idea and initial development to a partner interested in revolutionizing engineering workflows. If you are interested in this business opportunity, please contact:
